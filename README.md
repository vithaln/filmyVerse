#Name of the Application: FilmyVerse 
<br>
In this project we developed from scratch . the main moto of the application is FilmyVerse if 
a new user come to this application.<br> they need Register first by giving information<br>.
like name,mobile number and password . once we give mobile number we can send to the OTP request 
once we get OTP in mobile then we have to put and conform OTP.
<br>
Then he/she is the added in DB.
<br>
Then he/she needs to be login through Mobile number and password.
<br> 
I used fireBase for the Database.
<br>
onse user is the Authenticated then they can do post/add Image, give feedback and rating at particular posts.
<br>
and for styling I used Tailwind css and react-router-dom for the Routing.
<br> this project is all about functional Based components.
